  <p>When it comes to I18n support in Ruby on Rails there has a <strong>lot</strong> been going on in the last couple of weeks &#8230; and we expect it to become even more vibrant with the release of Rails 2.2 which is expected for the Rails Conf Europe in early September.</p> 
<p>We&#8217;ve set up this website to keep track of all the news and provide a central resource for Internationalization in Ruby on Rails. </p> 
<p>For starters here&#8217;s a short list of what happened in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>After we&#8217;ve been engaged in the Rails I18n Group since September last year we learned that in the RailsEnvy video <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2008/6/2/Railsconf-videos" title="Rails Envy: Railsconf Videos">RailsConf in 36 minutes</a> Jeremy Kemper, when asked what upcoming features that didn&#8217;t make it into Rails 2.1 he&#8217;d forsee on edge in the &#8220;next couple of weeks&#8221;, says that <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1104367" title="Jeremy Kemper at Railsconf 2008 on Vimeo">&#8220;Internationalization will be solved&#8221;</a>. </p> 
<p>Of course this sentence raised some eyebrows on our side at first but when we asked Jeremy on #rails-contrib about the interview he explained that he actually had been cracking a joke. We could have easily known that because shortly after he also announced that &#8220;Rails will scale&#8221; as an upcoming feature. Ha! ;)</p> 
<p>Nonetheless this interview sparked quite some additional motivation of finally getting our patch done because we felt affirmed in our goals and Jeremy even joined our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rails-i18n" title="rails-i18n | Google Groups">Google Group</a> in order to help us getting the patch done as soon as possible. Finally, on July 17th, Jeremy <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/636e6b7138864ceb1e309939cd879e710b287f3e" title="Commit 636e6b7138864ceb1e309939cd879e710b287f3e to rails's rails &mdash; GitHub">merged</a> our work back into Rails. We published a blog article about the <a href="http://www.artweb-design.de/2008/7/18/the-ruby-on-rails-i18n-core-api" title="The Ruby on Rails I18n core api - artweb design">technical details and API</a> as well as the <a href="http://www.artweb-design.de/2008/7/18/finally-ruby-on-rails-gets-internationalized" title="Finally. Ruby on Rails gets internationalized - artweb design">history and motiviation</a> of our work.</p> 
<p>Of course this merge raised quite some attention. Our work got mentioned on such hightraffic blogs like <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2008/7/20/internationalization-in-edge-rails-and-more" title="Riding Rails: Internationalization in edge Rails and more">Riding Rails</a>, <a href="http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2008/7/22/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-standard-internationalization-framework" title="Ryan's Scraps: What's New in Edge Rails: Standard Internationalization Framework">Ryan&#8217;s Scraps</a>, <a href="http://www.railsinside.com/news/52-rails-internationalization-in-2-2-i18n-module.html" title="Rails 2.2: Internationalizaton Implemented In Anger">Rails Inside</a> and the <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2008/7/23/rails-envy-podcast-episode-039-07-23-2008" title="Rails Envy: Rails Envy Podcast - Episode #039: 07/23/2008">RailsEnvy Podcast</a>. The member count of our Google Group consequently exploded and people started playing with the API.</p> 
<p>Trevor Turk was the first to provide a walkthrough for how to do <a href="http://almosteffortless.com/2008/07/21/simple-localization-in-rails-22/" title="Simple Localization in Rails 2.2 -  almost effortless">Simple Localization in Rails 2.2</a> and Iain Hecker published a <a href="http://github.com/iain/i18n_yaml" title="iain's i18n_yaml at master &mdash; GitHub">plugin for storing translations in YAML files</a> shortly after as well as a <a href="http://github.com/iain/http_accept_language" title="iain's http_accept_language at master &mdash; GitHub">plugin for parsing the HTTP Accept Language header</a>. </p> 
<p>We also learned with great pleasure about the attention that these changes raised amongst <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rails-i18n/browse_thread/thread/4ab0549d06fd6196" title="Great news from Japan">Rails developers in Japan</a> which is particulary awesome because Rails I18n development so far was quite segmented in the US/European and the Asian world.</p> 
<p>So, these are exciting times for Rails I18n. Stay tuned! Or better yet: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rails-i18n" title="rails-i18n | Google Groups">Get involved</a>!</p>
